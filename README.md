[My Open API Project - Learn more about Marvel Characters](https://github.com/purple-bird/veronica-fernandez-diaz-open-api)


This application will show a full list of all the characters of the Marvel universe using their API (https://developer.marvel.com/). When you click on a character, you will see that character's corresponding page with a short description of the character and a picture of the character, if available for that character. You can click on the back button to return to the list of all characters.

To run this project, please download and run locally.
